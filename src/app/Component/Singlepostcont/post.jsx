        <p className='descrip'>Fiction-writing specifically has modes such as action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.[3] Author Peter Selgin refers to methods, including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scenes, and description.[4] Currently, there is no consensus within the writing community regarding the number and composition of fiction-writing modes and their uses. Description is the fiction-writing mode for transmitting a mental image of the particulars of a story. Together with dialogue, narration, exposition, and summarization, description is one of the most widely recognized of the fiction-writing modes. As stated in Writing from A to Z, edited by Kirk Polking, description is more than the amassing of details; it is bringing something to life by carefully choosing and arranging words and phrases to produce the desired effect.[5] The most appropriate and effective techniques for presenting description are a matter of ongoing discussion among writers and writing coaches.</p>
